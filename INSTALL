To install crypt you can simply rename `crypt.sh` to `crypt` and move it in your path.
For example by doing:

	sudo cp crypt.sh /usr/bin/crypt


Similarly to install cryptmenu (which is a dmenu interface) you can do:

	sudo cp cryptmenu.sh /usr/bin/cryptmenu

Note that cryptmenu requires both dmenu and crypt to work.


To install the autocomplete scripts you can do something like:

	sudo cp completion/crypt.bash /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/crypt
	sudo cp completion/crypt.zsh /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_crypt
