To install crypt you can simply rename `crypt.sh` to `crypt` and move it in your path.
For example by doing
	sudo cp crypt.sh /usr/bin/crypt

Similarly, to install the autocomplete scripts you can do something like
	sudo cp extra/crypt.bash /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/crypt
	sudo cp extra/crypt.zsh /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_crypt
