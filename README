Crypt is a single bash script for managing an encrypted files repository.
Every file can be associated with actions (insert, edit, show, etc).
For example, you can have password entries and otp entries, the former being
copied to your clipboard when selected and the latter generating their code.
Or you could simply use it as a safe to keep your annotations.
It is really up to you how you want to configure your crypt.
